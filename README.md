## Hi there! I'm JohNNy!

### I'm a biologist by day and Developer by night!

- I'm currently doing a PhD in Genetics where I work with Bioinformatics
- I have a solid knowledge of the basics in Python, which is the language that most of my scripts are made of (for automation of simple tasks for my PhD)
- I'm in my second to last year as a distance education (aka, EaD in portuguese Brazil) student in Analysis and System Development at Wyden
- 2021 Goals: an internship or a Junior Dev job :'(
- Fun fact: I love to play games, read books and everything about new technologies!
